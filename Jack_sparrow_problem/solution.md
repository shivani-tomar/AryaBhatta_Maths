Suppose there are 'X' jacks and 'Y' sparrows .
Then according to question 

equation no 1:-
```
           X + 1 = Y - 1 
       =   X - Y = -2
```

equation no 2:-
```
           2*(X - 1) = Y + 1
       =   2X - 2 = Y + 1
       =   2X - Y = 3
```

from equation 1 and 2 :-
```
            X = 5
            Y = 7
```


So there are 5 jacks and 7 sparrows.
